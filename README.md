## Aaron Gill

I'm a newly appointed apprentice Software Developer in the Home Office, absolutely thrilled to have found my calling in the world of Software Development and to be given the opportunity to learn at such a well respected organisation - Maker's Academy.

After a career in the Civil Service performing a number of roles, including Business Analyst and writing Policy, I found myself increasingly involved in the technical side of things, with my aptitude in the area leading me to being offered a  position in the digital world.

Channelling my obsessive tendencies and unquenched thirst for learning, I have 'held my own' in an experienced, high performing team, despite being relatively new to the area and for the first time in my professional life, I really love what I do.

I hope to improve and be a great asset for any business - I'm Not the finished article by any means but I have a compulsion to improve, great interpersonal skills and a good foundation to build upon.
